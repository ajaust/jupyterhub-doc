KULeuven JupyterHub documentation
========================

Current status

.. code-block:: none

   Nothing to report

Last update: 2018-11-12

General information
-------------------

Users have to be added to the project by hand so your colleagues cannot
use the service without being explicitly added by us. 

The following resources are currently available:

-  5, 10 or 20 minutes of walltime

-  9 CPUs, 1 GPU, 45gb of memory (1/4th of a GPU node) per session

-  Four users/sessions can use the service at a time. Only one GPU node is available during the testing phase. This means there can be some waiting time until the session starts or a session might fail to start.


The current settings should give everybody the opportunity to test their
workflow and provide initial feedback. We hope that with the current
settings the queuing times are not too long. If your notebook does not
start quickly, please try at a later time. We might have to change the
appearance of the service and services provided. Moreover, we might have
to take the service offline for fixing and improving the service. This
should be indicated on this website.

We are planning to increase the range of features of the service over
time. This includes the hardware and walltime that can be requested.
However, this includes modifying the software installed on the compute
nodes which we do not want to do on all nodes at the moment. Therefore
it is important to get your feedback so we can judge the amount of
compute facilities needed by you.

This page will collect information obtained during the testing phase. We
try to keep it up to date and inform about changes on this site.
